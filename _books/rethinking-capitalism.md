**Check in with capitalism, with Mariana Mazzucato and Michael Jacobs.** The financial crisis of 2008 showed two deep failures: not only did economic policy fail to prevent the crash, economics as an academic discipline failed to foresee it. Mazzucato and Jacobs bring together a crack team of economists to rebuild our understanding of modern economics, addressing the most pressing themes of weak and unstable growth, stagnating wages and standards of living, and climate change and other environmental risk. This handbook provides not only theoretical explanations of the evidence, but policy prescriptions based on that evidence.
