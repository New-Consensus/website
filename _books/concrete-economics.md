***Concrete Economics* tells much of the same story as Bad Samaritans, but focuses exclusively on the United States,** and does so in language even more accessible to mainstream, economically centrist audiences. Cohen and DeLong show how over the course of American history, “the invisible hand [of the market] was repeatedly lifted at the elbow by government, and replaced in a new position from where it could go on to perform its magic.” Again and again, under different coalitions and with different aims, government intervened for the practical purpose of making America stronger, wealthier, larger; until in the 1980s, the interventions took a turn for the ideological, turning “free markets” into a false idol—and planting the seeds of today’s billionaire class.
