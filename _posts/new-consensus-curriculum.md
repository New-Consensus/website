## For a new generation of American leaders.
*This is a draft outline, presented here to solicit feedback, for something that could be developed into a series of presentations that would serve as a curriculum for new American leaders. In many ways, Americans all across the political spectrum have lost sight of the fundamental concepts and principles that have allowed humanity to improve life and expand freedom over the past centuries. Partly this comes from a legacy on both sides of America's political divide of rewriting and simplifying history to prop up partisan myths. This curriculum is designed to reintroduce lost foundations so that a new generation of leaders may chart their own course with knowledge and awareness that has been missing for too long. In the final product, each unit would be a series of short presentations that could be given over a day-long session, or one per day or week. Each presentation would have a discussion guide and a list of sources for further reading.*

## Unit 1: Foundations of freedom and prosperity in nations

### Describing the foundations as they are in the present:

* **Institutions**: Organizations, government, businesses, banks, markets, constitutions, civil & human rights, laws, regulations.
* **Knowledge**: Know-how, education, skills, experiences, traditions, culture.
* **“Means of making a living”**: Factories, farms, studios, offices, where humans make what they need.
* **Infrastructure**: The built environment – homes, buildings, sewers, water systems, roads, levees, seawalls.
* **Technology**: Tools, equipment, machines, techniques, to build the things we need (including infrastructure).
* **Natural resources**: Minerals, water, sunlight, wind, fossil fuels, forests, etc….

### Content:

* Covid-19 as an example: how the assets listed above allowed some countries to respond better than others. It didn't come down to one factor such as "authoritarianism" (see Taiwan, Korea, Australia, Germany). Factors that mattered: functional, decisive leadership, ability to produce or quickly procure and distribute things (such as masks, test kits, countless other little things that aided in controlling the virus such as plexiglass dividers for taxis, signage, barriers), etc....
* How in normal times all these things share our lives in ways we don't even think about. In prosperous, free countries most of these things have been developed to a high level.
* South Korea vs. Philippines. Philippines was far ahead of SK at end of WWII. SK now far ahead. What makes the difference? Industry, competent government, many other assets above. But important to notice that you don't need all. SK has very few natural resources.
* What is the state of the US when it comes to these assets?
* We'll get into the history of how a nation develops these assets in Unit _, but first, in the next couple units, we need to cover some fundamentals.

## Unit 2: What are nations, how do they work, where did they come from?

### Main ideas:
* Nations are a new configuration of humanity. (Invented in the most recent 1% of human existence.)
* Humanity is still working out how to structure, lead, and live in nations. Every nation is an experiment in motion.
* Nations, like everything, have beginnings and endings, can decay, can be restored, and are always changing.
* All nations have leadership systems (that are constantly changing) with varying power to make things happen, including making systemic changes to the nation as a whole.
* All nations drift through phases of effective and ineffective leadership, and through phases of positive and negative leadership.

### Content:
* Quick timeline of development of human society from hunter gatherers to the formation of nations.
* What defines a modern nation / what they all have in common (examples).
* How every different kind of leadership system can perform really well or really badly with regard to making reforms and improvements (examples).
* Institutions of nations are easy to tinker with but very hard to change. Nevertheless, a unified leadership group can make dramatic changes in sweeping reform movements or revolutions (examples).
* The history of nations developing is a story of waves of innovation and then others following out of fear/admiration.
* China, with governing institutions that lasted thousands of years, offers an interesting example: Every few hundred years, the leadership group, as represented by a dynastic emperor, had let things slide so badly that rebellions would break out that the weakened state could not defeat. A new leader from the rebel group–often a person from a humble background–would take control of the ancient institutions and begin to repair and rebuild the nation's means of making a living. The rise of the new leader allowed for a break with special interests who had been able to block the reform attempts by previous leaders. Many officials and elites from the preexisting order enthusiastically joined the new regime to undo the wrongs of the past.
* Elsewhere in the world, there are few examples where the same set of institutions lasted so long, serving a relatively consistent geography, to be reused over and over, gradually being upgraded with every new ruling group.
* In Europe, England comes the closest, with institutions (e.g. some form of constitutional monarchy) in continuous use for more than

## Unit 3: What is the USA, how does it work, where did it come from?

### Outline:

* The first Americans arrived 10s of thousands of years ago from Asia. Civilizations rose and fell. An incredible diversity of civilizations and ways of life thrived over thousands of years before the European arrival and ensuing cataclysm for Native Americans, which killed possibly 95% of the original population. Native Americans did not disappear, but organized new nations, empires and alliances with American and European Nations. Europeans interacted with Native Americans  as separate sovereign nations, and were influenced by them as they forged their own nations and national alliances. All of modern American history would include struggle for land and resources between European and Native American nations.
* The present day cultural divide was already in effect on the Mayflower, which transported two groups of people: “saints” and “strangers.” America’s division started right there. The Puritans seeded one of America’s most important cultures, to become the "Northeastern liberal elite"–characterized by a sense of self-righteousness based on a masochistic yet cleansing self-hatred. Puritans knew what was right, and felt a duty to force everyone around them to conform. This led to many skisms. The "strangers" (the non-religious passengers on the Mayflower) ran away to the west, and remained as grumbling dissenters.
* The other great power center of early America, Virginia, was settled first in Jamestown by lazy failed aristocrats who would rather starve than work, eventually being saved by one of their own who saw the error in their ways, John Smith. The American ruling class being repeatedly saved by an ass-kicking black sheep from their own group would be a recurring theme.
* New European nations in America (the colonies) were forged by settlers with a particular set of institutions brought from England – that were born out of 1,000 years of struggle between kings, clergy, aristocrats, small landowners, serfs, tenants, and landless poor people.
* At the beginning of European settlement, different parts of the US were settled by very different cultures of people (mostly from England, yet from different counties, each with very different political cultures, histories, almost even with different languages) – these political cultures persist today and explain a lot about present day American politics and culture. (Show American Nations map.)
* New England was founded as a utopian, egalitarian project. Care was taken to prevent anyone family accumulating too much land, and to make sure that all (English) families in the area had access to enough land to live on. The community's leaders were highly motivated to "save" Native Americans–in fact this was a big part of the rationale for them to come to America. Utopia soon unraveled, as the highly educated Puritans came to rely on English "indentured servants" and African Slaves, and as a group of wealthy merchants accumulated great wealth and power over the colony. Massachusetts was the first state to enshrine permanent slavery into law.
* Virginia was also powered by English indentured servants and African slaves, without any pretense of equality, even, among free English people.
* Early America was a society of classes and castes: Slaves, servants, masters, gentlemen, clergy, the middling sort, the lower sort, husbands, wives, children, workers, tradesmen, and merchants.
The invention and refinement of the idea of race; the invention of black and white.
* For a long time, America was primarily an ownership society. What that meant, how it happened, how it was maintained.
* The American Revolution – 100 years in the making. A real social revolution, making class distinction a taboo, if not actually eliminating it. Thirteen separate nations, with 13 revolutionary legislatures, "filled with butchers and bakers." Almost the first time this happened in the world, and the first time it stuck.
* The formation of the United States of America through the Constitution and ratification process.
* Tests of the new nation: Hamilton's bid to build a superpower, uprisings, decision on freedom in America, War of 1812, struggle over the American agenda (Hamilton & Clay vs. Jefferson & Jackson)
* "Manifest Destiny" – building an empire across North America. Conquest and moving of Native American nations, purchase of lands, conquest of Spanish Floria and a huge chunk of Mexico (all of the South West and half the West of present USA).
* The Civil War, Reconstruction, the re-enslavement, disenfranchisement, and confiscation of wealth of African Americans. Creation of the railroads, telegraphs, globalization of the American farmer and shopkeeper.
* How America became a proletarian society – in other words how Americans lost their land. The creation of a new permanent underclass of poor whites.
* Asian American immigration and struggles with anti-immigrant movements.
* Review of some movements that have reshaped American society in significant ways: rural uprisings, slave uprisings, anti-slavery and abolitionist movements, labor, populists (of the 1880s-1910s in the South, West and Midwest), women's suffrage, temperance, civil rights, women's, conservative, anti-Vietnam war, gay rights, Tea Party, new right, trans rights, anti-police violence.
* The US leadership system is primarily driven by politicians who make and implement laws, and who, with media personalities and civic and religious leaders, occasionally influence public opinion in national campaigns or times of crisis.
* Many factions of interest groups (e.g. business) exert pressure on leaders in many directions, but this is true of all nations in all eras.
* The US state is strong, but no one has used it for proactive reform in a long time.

## Unit 4: How nations build and rebuild their means of making a living

### Outline:

* The earliest humans, who lived as hunter gatherers, actively developed and maintained their means of making a living by training, building tools and weapons, making hard decisions about when to move to new territory, or when to attack or flee from a competitor group. All early humans lived in groups of around 100-150. It was impossible for hunter gathers to develop classes or castes because it was almost impossible to store and accumulate food or wealth. Everyone always had free access to the means of making a living because it was always immediately all around them.
* After agriculture developed and people began to live more stationary existences, it then became possible to store food and new kinds of wealth (animals, buildings, pottery, and many other new types of goods). Agriculture was practiced by tradition, changing slowly. Societies grew in size far past 150 individuals.
* Leadership in agricultural societies began communally, like hunter gatherer society, but eventually elite groups emerged who organized into cliques that used violence to control the means of making a living (the land).
* Agricultural societies gradually evolved their means of making a living through a mix of proactive experimentation by leaders and farmers (which was always opposed by tradition and inertia) and by gradual adaptation and mutation of traditions.
* Starting several hundred years ago, the pace of change began to speed up as new technological innovations led to more innovation, and as some modernizing nations proactively supported innovation and change in farming and manufacturing as a national policy.
* Through the 1700s, 1800s, and 1900s some handful of nations somewhere in the world were always racing to advance their means of making a living. They did this under all different kinds of political systems
* We don't know whether small hunter gatherer societies ever allowed their means of making a living to decay. Such decay might have been too easily visible to last for very long, and any decline would immediately effect everyone in the group more or less the same. In hunter gather societies there was usually very little capacity to store food and almost no hunter gatherer society was able to develop a class structure where some people would be able to prosper while others went hungry – it just wasn't physically possible given the kind of food and technology the societies had to work with. But who knows!
* Once societies became larger and more complex and developed the ability to store food and new forms of wealth, however, it became possible for leadership groups to fall asleep at the wheel and stop maintaining and developing their societies means of making a living. Partly, this was because a social decline did not have to affect the leadership group. The leadership group could grow richer by extracting more wealth from the rest of society even as most people went hungry.
* Moreover, once a society got big enough, the leadership group could feel less of a responsibility for the state of the society. Individual leaders could come to feel that, for example, the state of transportation, education, natural resource conservation, and industrialization was beyond their influence. If the leadership group lost (or never developed) an ability to deliberate and act decisively and proactively, then
* When a leadership group allows the nation's means of making a living to fall into decay, more of the nation's people fall into poverty, the health of the people slides (life expectancy and other indicators worsen),
