**Then read Ann Pettifor’s book to prove to yourself that all this really is possible.** In this book, Ann shows how in all of our societies, with all of our people, resources and technology, “we can afford what we can do.” Starting from key concepts in money, finance, and economics, and she shows how the economic institutions of the modern world, from governments and central banks through financial markets and private banks interact with the real wealth creators—across all industries and sectors. Understanding where money comes from and where productivity comes from, you’ll be ready to explain how the two things are really related (and it isn’t “let the people who already have the money decide!”).
