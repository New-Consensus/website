Then read a much better-researched and objective account of the mobilization for World War II in Mark Wilson’s ***Destructive Creation***. Accounts of American arms production—“the arsenal of democracy,” in Roosevelt’s memorable phrase—have centered the business leaders of the time, portraying them as patriotic heroes (in the right-wing narrative) or as rapacious villains and war profiteers (in a left-wing understanding). Wilson cuts these business leaders down to size; while their motives were mixed, he shows, they just weren’t as important as either account makes them. Rather, America’s mobilization was managed by dedicated government public servants as much as by businessmen.
