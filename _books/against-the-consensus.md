**Let Justin Lin clue you in to what the world economy looks like from Beijing.** Five hundred years ago, China’s wealth was orders of magnitude greater than Europe’s (Europe, meanwhile, was starting to fill its coffers with South American gold and silver), and China sees the past half -millennium as a soon-to-be-corrected aberration in the order of the world. Justin Lin is one of the figures at the center of China’s current transformation.. After serving as the chief economist of the World Bank through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, he gives his take on what’s really going on. The measures taken to contain the crisis, Lin makes clear, are insufficient to forestall years or even decades of globally-depressed growth; bold, counter-cyclical government investment across the globe is badly needed.
