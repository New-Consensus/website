**Learn about the biggest, baddest entrepreneur in history from Mariana Mazzucato.** *The Entrepreneurial State* documents how virtually every innovative and dynamic part of the U.S. economy has been funded essentially by public venture capital. But itâ€™s a very strange sort of venture capital that takes no stake in exchange for its investments (Why? Because, in the self-serving logic of the American wealthy, private=good, public=bad!). Learn how every cool piece of technology in your smartphone was developed by a company that was venture-backed by the U.S. government, decades before anyone else saw any practical application for the technology.
