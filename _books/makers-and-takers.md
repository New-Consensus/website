**Let Rana Foroohar introduce you to the good guys and the bad guys in *Makers and Takers*.** Mitt Romney famously divided America into two camps, but Foroohar shows us who the real makers are, and the real takers. Makers are people who add value to our economy, as workers, entrepreneurs, caregivers, artists, parents and grandparents and others. The takers on Wall Street use the power of de facto government-insured credit and government bailouts to suck huge amounts of wealth out of the economy.
