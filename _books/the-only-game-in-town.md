**And if one mainstream econ guy wasn’t enough, then read former PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian who says it too.** “This book,” he writes, "is not just about consequential destinations that affect the well-being of both current and future generations. It is also about the ongoing transition that is likely to feature even more improbables and unthinkables becoming reality.” As political and economic developments continue to shock experts, El-Erian’s analysis provides not only the tools to understand what’s going on, but his policy prescriptions—starting from the breakout proposition that democratically-elected governments must intervene in the economy beyond central bank activity—can help avert the worst of these shocks and build a broader and more stable base of economic growth.
