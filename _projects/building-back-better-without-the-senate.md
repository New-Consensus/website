summary: 'Joe Biden has campaigned on an ambitious plan to not just end the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic depression, but to "Build Back Better" through massive investments in industry and infrastructure. Through these trillions in investments, he aims to rebuild the auto industry to become 100% electric, upgrade factories to become clean and build new clean factories, invest in R&D and new technology, and much more. But many have worried that without a Democratic majority in the Senate, Biden may need to dial back the ambition of his plan. In this memo to the Biden transition team, we lay out exactly how he can do almost all of "Build Back Better" even without a cooperative Senate, and how there is clear precedent for doing so.'

Memorandum
To: President-Elect Biden & Vice President-Elect Harris
From: New Consensus
Date: 17 November 2020
Re: Building Back Better with or without Senate Majority
Dear President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris,
We could not be happier for the nation that you have won election to the
White House. Congratulations! In a spirit of both celebration and collaboration, we
wish to show in this Memo how much you can do to ‘Build [Our Country] Back
Better’ whether you have a cooperative majority in the Senate next year or not.
The most urgent task you will face, as you’ve noted with reassuring
frequency, is of course the yet-again spiking Covid pandemic that has devastated our
nation since early this year. Happily you have already named a full Task Force,
headed by experienced public health experts with knowledge of medicine and public
health crises alike, to commence planning our nation’s long-awaited mobilization
and coordinated response this past week.
While arresting and reversing the ongoing pandemic will be a major
achievement, it will also be little more than a prerequisite to addressing a
longer-term task that has been decades in the making – the task of rebuilding and
renewing our republic, its supply chains and productive capacities, and its social
fabric – what you have aptly called ‘the Soul of our Republic.’ After decades of
unremitting deindustrialization and infrastructural degradation, along with the
social unraveling that such decline always brings, our nation is in need of a thorough
public health and industrial-infrastructural reconstruction – what you’ve called a
‘Building Back Better.’
It is of course possible that you will have both House and Senate majorities to
work with in pursuit of our national healing. But it also is possible that you will have
no more than the ‘advice’ of, without much ‘consent’ from, the Senate. We offer the
following three-part Plan – a sort of ‘three-legged stool’ for national
redevelopment – with that possibility in view. We begin with a fuller definition of
the Task, then elaborate the Plan, and finally enumerate the benefits that will flow
from the Plan’s implementation.
1
1. The Task
The most urgent task facing our nation once the current pandemic is ended
will be to renew, comprehensively and cost-effectively, our nation’s full productive
powers across all sectors of our economy and all regions of our continent-spanning
republic. The U.S. should be second-to-none as an incubator and grower of
tomorrow’s industries, and as a producer, consumer, and exporter of
environmentally sustainable products, services, and technologies. This is a goal that
Republicans, Democrats, and Independents presumably all share.
The U.S. must also achieve this aim in a manner that brings renewed
productive activity to literally every Congressional district in the country (as the
New Deal did), and that optimally combines the efforts of both the public and
private sectors, of all sectors of our economy, and of all levels of government, from
local to federal. This was one of the secrets of the success of the New Deal – its
comprehensiveness both as a sectoral and as a geographical matter, as one would
hope of any grand national project that would be small ‘d’ democratic. It will also be
a means of beginning to heal the ethnic and urban/rural divides that now scar our
nation – as recent electoral trends indicate and as had occurred before the original
New Deal too.
This broad ambition seems to us to entail three distinguishable but mutually
complementary objectives – what we can call ‘the three “I”s’:
1.1. Industries: We must foster, nurture, and scale-up to self-sufficiency today
the industries of tomorrow – from solar panels through wind-turbine
generators and 6G networks, to life-extension, space exploration and far
beyond. These industries, again, should be spread across the entire
nation, in a manner encouraging even development continent-wide. This
is what we did in the 1930s and 1940s, and is what we must do again.
1.2. Infrastructures: We must provide state-of-the-art renditions of all
essential shared infrastructures on which business firms, industries, and
our citizens rely – from transport networks through communications
networks and power grids to above-ground private transit, high tech
schools and beyond. Here too it is not just a matter of restoring what we
have, but also of building what in future we’ll need.
1.3. Investments: Because 1.1 and 1.2 have many attributes of what the
economists call ‘public goods,’ in which private sector actors have neither
the jurisdictional authority nor the coordinative or financial capacity to
invest in socially optimal amounts, we must collectively make
strategic self-liquidating public investments in fulfillment of objectives 1.1
and 1.2, precisely in order to make private investments in future
more viable and more profitable. We should ensure that this public
2
investment is both (a) adequate to the vast scale of the task, and (b)
sufficiently growth-generating as to afford the means of publicly
extinguishing loans or remunerating equity investments with the proceeds
of successful projects or project portfolios. That is how any investor
ensures that expenditures are bona fide investments rather than mere
expenditures alone. Note that this means, when the investments are
public, that they will not be inflationary; for they yield the very products,
services, and infrastructures that will absorb the moneys spent to finance
them.
2. The Instrumentalities
We already have all federal instrumentalities needed both to make a concerted
national project of 1, and to meet the specific objectives of 1.1 through 1.3, above.
This means that however desirable new bipartisan legislation might be as a matter
of signaling, it will not strictly speaking be necessary to effectuate the plan that we
now propose. The President, the Vice President, the Cabinet and the Federal Reserve
can make all four of the following institutional reconfigurations under existing law
with a view to ensuring coherent and coordinated planning and execution of a
comprehensive and capacious national rebuilding.
2.1. National Development Council: The President, the Vice President, the
Secretary of the Treasury, the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors, and the heads of all Cabinet-Level Agencies of the National
Government with jurisdiction over critical industries and infrastructures
should first form a National Development Council (NDC) charged with two
tasks: (a) formulating and regularly updating a coordinated National
Development Strategy (NDS) highlighting industries and infrastructures
of national and global significance that the U.S. can and should foster,
grow, and globally lead on; and (b) developing specific projects or project
portfolios in pursuit of the NDS. This is what our national defense agencies
do, and it is high time our infrastructural and industrial agencies did
likewise – think and plan systematically and strategically ahead. The
Council should meet at least monthly. It should also include, in ex officio
capacities, the Speaker of the House, the House Majority Leader, the
Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, and both state and city officials as
well as private sector business leaders, in order to maximize ‘input’ as to
what the nation’s perceived industrial and infrastructural needs are. For
reasons elaborated below in 2.3, our regional Federal Reserve Banks
should participate too.
2.2. National Development Bank: A National Development Bank (NDB),
formed as a fund within Treasury, can function as a coordinated-financing
arm of the NDC. The Treasury’s already-existent Federal Financing
3
Bank (FFB) can also be used for this purpose. (Cf. PL-93224, 87 Stat. 937.)
Either way, the NDB will develop specific financing plans for specific NDC
projects or project portfolios, subject to NDC approval. Depending on the
projects, financing modalities can include direct grants, loans, forgivable
loans, equity investments, and of course combinations of these.
These financing modalities can also permit for private investment
alongside public investment on some projects, as a means of absorbing
investment capital that might otherwise inflate financial bubbles, on
condition that private investors shall under no circumstances have ‘say’
over, as distinguished from offering advice in connection with, NDC
projects. The NDB may also contract or otherwise collaborate with other
federal agencies – the Army Corps of Engineers, for example – to execute
all or part of some projects.
2.3. ‘Spread’ the Fed:Completing the Plan’s institutional reconfigurations will
be a restoration of the Federal Reserve System’s original purpose. The
Federal Reserve System (FRS) was originally conceived as a network of
regional development-finance assistance institutions – the Regional
Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs) – coordinated and overseen by a Board of
Governors (Fed Board) in Washington. Regional FRBs monetized
commercial paper issued by small businesses either directly or indirectly
(through local community banks). This original mission of the Regional
FRBs should be restored, with the banks monetizing paper associated
with promisingly productive – not merely profitable – new projects or
business expansions across every region of the nation. In effect, this
mission has already begun to be restored in the form of the Fed’s new
Municipal Liquidity and Main Street Lending Programs. The problem is
that these are administered entirely by shoestring staffs at the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
respectively, which makes no sense administratively and is unfair to the
FRB staffs. We must accordingly ‘Spread the Fed’ by distributing
administration of its locally oriented programs across all of the regional
FRBs. The Fed Board will afford guidance to the Regional FRBs as to what
counts as ‘productive’ by reference to the NDS formulated by the NDC, on
which the Fed Chair sits. This will help integrate Fed action both with
democratically determined NDC decisions (2.1 above) and with NDB
operations (2.2 above). NDB financing can also be coordinated with
regional FRBs. (See, e.g., 31 U.S.C. §§ 5301 and 5302.) The
aforementioned NDB may also maintain offices in the Regional FRBs to
enable fuller coordination. And the Regional FRBs will retain their
present authority to open additional offices in cities throughout their
jurisdictions, to ensure adequate Fed development assistance in literally
every precinct of the country in need of it. This presence in all
Congressional Districts, again, was one of the keys to the original New
Deal’s success.

2.4. Digital Taxpayer Wallets: The reconfigurations just elaborated will of
course add assets to the public balance sheet, continuing a trend that
grew noticeable in 2008 and greatly accelerated with the coming of Covid
last winter. Corresponding to these new assets, of course, will be new
liabilities, which we believe should take the following form: Either the
Fed or the Treasury will establish a system of peer-to-peer (P2P) digital
‘Taxpayer Wallets’ through which citizens, businesses, and approved
residents can transact ‘vertically’ with public entities and ‘horizontally’
with one another in real time. The already-existing ‘TreasuryDirect’
system of electronic accounts, which allows any person who wishes to
buy or sell Treasury Securities literally within seconds, can be converted
into such a system within weeks. So says U.S. Digital Service, an agency of
our Executive charged with keeping the technology used by our
government ‘state of the art.’ Later the digital wallet system can be
migrated over to the Fed, enabling our central bank to
conduct ‘leak-proof’ monetary policy by offering interest on wallets to
slow down spending in periods of overheating growth, and lowering rates
or even making direct stimulus expenditures (digital ‘helicopter drops’)
into wallets during slowdowns. Among the advantages offered by such a
system will be: (a) commercial inclusion and free public retail banking to
all citizens, businesses, and approved residents; (b) faster transaction
speeds and hence higher ‘money velocity’ and associated growth;
(c) secure payments and banking privacy; (d) keeping ahead of global
competitors like China and other countries now developing digital fiat
currencies; and finally, (e) an easy means of making fast small business
loans in keeping with 2.2 and 2.3 just above. If you worry about too much
competition with private sector banks, you can always cap wallet
amounts at, say, $3,000. In the long run, banking more of the 25% of
Americans who are now un- or under-banked will bring more Americans
even into private sector banking, as they grow used to the benefits of
using accounts rather than payday lenders.
3. The Benefits
The Plan just elaborated offers a plethora of benefits that should recommend
it to Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike. Among these are:
3.1. Growth & Employment: The boost in productive investment that the Plan
affords will generate both enormous growth and enormous employment
gains in high-quality, high-paying industrial and infrastructure jobs
across our full continent-spanning republic. That will in turn also
generate increased federal, state, and local revenues.
5
3.2. Innovation & Small Business Ownership: The restoration of the Fed’s
small business fostering mandate under the Plan will aid cutting-edge
new businesses, as well as sole proprietorships, family firms, family
farms, and worker-owned firms in gaining a toehold in the fast-paced
American economy. And again, this will occur across our continental
republic’s full geographic expanse.
3.3. Greentech Growth: The Plan’s focus on tomorrow’s industries will
perforce be investment in green technologies with vast
carbon-eliminating and planet-preserving significance. State-of-the-art
industries and infrastructures are now green industries and
infrastructures, such that to modernize is to harmonize with a livable
planet.
3.4. Export Growth: The Plan’s focus on cutting-edge industries with great
export potential will help restore America’s lost role as a world leader
both in developing new industries and in prospering through worldwide
demand for its unrivalled products.
3.5. Debt & Deficit Reduction: The Plan’s focus on projects that are in
aggregate self-liquidating – that is, remunerably productive – will both
reduce public debt and avoid inflationary pressure, precisely because its
expenditures are used to finance the production of the very goods and
services that will absorb newly generated credit and money, rather than
simply to speculate on secondary financial and derivatives markets on
already-existing paper assets.
3.6. Financial Stability: By rerouting investment capital to productive
investments rather than speculative secondary and derivative financial
markets, the Plan will eliminate the principal source of the financial
volatility that has plagued the nation’s financial markets over the past
several decades – namely, the flow of credit to financial rather than real
assets over three decades of degraded and ‘outsourced’ production.
3.7. Wealth & Income Inequality: Finally, by both growing jobs in
remunerative manufacturing and infrastructure on the one hand, and
ending financial bubbles whose aftermaths always worsen inequality on
the other hand, the Plan will assist with the urgent multi-sectoral task of
restoring an equitable sharing of the nation’s resumed growth. Few
developments could do more to restore cultural health and social
stability to our ailing nation.

Conclusion
The Plan we’ve just outlined, again, can be pursued with or without formal
legislation. Of course the latter might be desirable and even forthcoming in light of
its obviously nonpartisan, pro-growth appeal, and we’ve no doubt you will be
seeking it. But should that not happen, as you know, the nation does not have the
luxury of waiting for such perks before tackling its most urgent and indeed
‘existentially’ compelling needs. What can legally be done must quickly be done. This
is especially the case when lack of bipartisan support has become often less a matter
of good faith disagreement over policy merits and more a matter of self-interested
tactical jockeying for partisan power at or during the next electoral cycle.
 The keys to the Plan’s success are several. First is its focus on
both cutting-edge industry and state-of-the-art infrastructure. Second is its careful
coordination of efforts coherently across all sectors of the economy and all
Congressional Districts of the nation, not to mention all levels of government and
both our public and private sectors. And finally third is its making optimal use of
instrumentalities that we already have, simply reconfiguring them so as to enable
them to address new challenges and new circumstances.
In this sense, the Plan is as ‘conservative’ as it is transformative – it merely
‘tweaks,’ but it does so in ‘levered,’ ‘high impact’ fashion. We can thus think of it
much as we might think of the gear shift on the bicycle that President-Elect Biden
rides to keep fit (a version of ‘Ridin’ with Biden’): a quick flick of the thumb or
forefinger enables immediate acceleration to one’s desired speed, no matter the
slope – uphill or down – of the terrain we are riding. Let us, then, start the ride. And
please know we are eager to assist you in any way that we can.
Godspeed!
