***Bad Samaritans* is the best, globally-oriented account of how economic progress really happens.** Ha-Joon Chang has written some other great new books (see below), but Bad Samaritans is the book to start with: it tells the full story of how the rich countries got rich. It wasn’t through individual innovations or brilliant investment or “letting the market be free,” but by trying as societies—by building institutions such as national investment banks, non-profit savings bank networks, state-owned or state-backed industries, infrastructure and education designed to promote industrial development, and so on. It’s not just history, either; Chang shows how all the countries today making economic and social progress are still using those kinds of institutions.
