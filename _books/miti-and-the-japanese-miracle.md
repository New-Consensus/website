**The South Korean story had its origins in the story of the post-war Japanese model.** We’re all familiar with the big Japanese industrial conglomerates—Yamaha, which produces everything from motorcycles to concert pianos, for example—and on first glance they may seem to be examples of unrestrained capitalism, reminiscent of the Gilded Age monopolies in the US like Standard Oil and US Steel. But as Chalmers Johnson shows, these corporations represent a totally different—and vastly more successful—model: significant, sustained, and high-quality intervention from the Japanese government. The “Japanese miracle” of decades of economic growth and synonymy with high-quality, low-cost manufacturing was not accidental but created and sustained by Japan’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
