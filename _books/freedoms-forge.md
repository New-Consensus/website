**And now that you know we need to launch a massive national rebuilding project in every nation, it’s time to learn about some of the ways that nations have done this in the past.** Have your breath taken away by Freedom’s Forge, and its account of the massive public-private alliance that won World War II. This book is written by a hard right-wing historian, which makes it all the better to read. He provides a great model here for how to explain a national economic building project in terms that conservatives will like.
